# Advent of Code Progress

This repository contains my personal solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an advent calendar.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to track my progress as I attempt to solve the Advent of Code challenges. It's a fun way to improve my programming skills and get into the holiday spirit!

## Structure

Each day's challenge is in its respective directory, named `day01`, `day02`, ..., `day25`. Inside each directory, you'll find two files:

- `solution.rb`: My Ruby solution for the day's challenge.
- `input.txt`: The challenge input provided by Advent of Code.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day:

```bash
ruby dayXX/solution.rb
